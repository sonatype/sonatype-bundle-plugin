Apache Felix Framework
Copyright 2006 The Apache Software Foundation

Apache Felix is an effort undergoing incubation at 
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is 
required of all newly accepted projects until a further 
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, 
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner 
consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the 
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate 
that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
